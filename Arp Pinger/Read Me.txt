This Arp Pinger tool developed by zThyphon.

I know it is a basic tool (because it is my first cybersecurity tool). I'll improve myself and I'll add more complex
cybersecurity tools to github (https://github.com/zThyphon) in time.

Usage
Linux:
1) Go arppinger.py location
2) Use this command: python arppinger.py -i ip_address/24
For example: python arppinger.py -i 192.168.1.1/24
